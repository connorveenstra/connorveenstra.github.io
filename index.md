##### Sample Poem
###### I can still remember the very day you came, A little ball of golden fur shivering in the rain, We all gathered round you, my siblings and me, To meet the new addition of our growing family, Though you were scared at first you quickly took to us, Now looking back I can’t recall what life without you was, You learned to run and play with me, learned to shake my hand, That was thirteen years ago, now you can barely stand, Your fur is still as gold as ever, but now it’s full of blots, Warts, rashes, dead skin patches and several balding spots, You’re now an old man, but I’m still that little boy, Excited for a brand new pet, squealing out with joy, Soon, we’ll need to say goodbye. When that day finally comes, I’ll hope and pray to God above He’s got a place for dogs.
